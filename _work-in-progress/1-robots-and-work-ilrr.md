excerpt: "First R&R at ILR Review\n\nCo-authored with Avner Ben-Ner and Ainhoa Urtasun\n\nThis paper examines the effects of robot adoption on employment and skills in US manufacturing plants (2010-2022). Using a difference-in-differences method, we find a 150% increase in job postings and a 15% increase in employment in plants that adopt robots compared to non-adopters matched by industry and labor market. Increased competitiveness due to robots raises output with positive employment spillover effects in non-robotized stages of adopting plants and in upstream and downstream non-robotic plants within adopting firms. Skill composition remains largely unchanged, with more design, production, maintenance, repair, and programming skills required in robotized areas. Productivity and robot-human complementarity effects dominate displacement, with job losses limited to outcompeted non-adopters. Our multilevel approach reveals underestimation of robotization effects in prior firm-level studies. Industry-level employment effects are negligible due to counterbalancing gains and losses. Findings suggest the need for policies facilitating robot adoption while supporting displaced workers."

This paper examines the effects of robot adoption on employment and skills in US manufacturing plants (2010-2022). Using a difference-in-differences method, we find a 150% increase in job postings and a 15% increase in employment in plants that adopt robots compared to non-adopters matched by industry and labor market. Increased competitiveness due to robots raises output with positive employment spillover effects in non-robotized stages of adopting plants and in upstream and downstream non-robotic plants within adopting firms. Skill composition remains largely unchanged, with more design, production, maintenance, repair, and programming skills required in robotized areas. Productivity and robot-human complementarity effects dominate displacement, with job losses limited to outcompeted non-adopters. Our multilevel approach reveals underestimation of robotization effects in prior firm-level studies. Industry-level employment effects are negligible due to counterbalancing gains and losses. Findings suggest the need for policies facilitating robot adoption while supporting displaced workers.
