# Work in the preliminary phase (ideation, data collection, and preliminary findings)

### Are Employee-Owned Firms Luddites? Effects of Ownership on Adoption of Robots and Employment after Adoption

_Co-authored with Avner Ben-Ner and Ainhoa Urtasun_

This paper evaluates whether firms with Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP) – employee-owned firms – exhibit “Luddite” opposition toward manufacturing automation adoption compared to conventional firms. Leveraging data about robot adoption between 2010-2022 for 34,000 U.S. manufacturing plants and over 8 million job postings, we use logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of adoption and difference-in-differences analysis to assess the effect of adoption on subsequent hiring of workers in various occupations among adopting and non-adopting plants. 

Results indicate that plants in employee-owned firms exhibit a significantly greater propensity to deploy industrial robots than plants in conventional firms. This contradicts the intuitive expectation that employee-owned firms will resist automation more vigorously to protect jobs. Moreover, we find that unionized conventional plants are less likely to adopt robots as compared to their non-unionized counterpart, in line with the Luddite tradition and the extremely limited empirical evidence on this matter (Noble 1986). In contrast, unions did not seem to have any effect on plants in employee-owned firms; instead, the propensity to adopt robots was even stronger when ESOPs were introduced through union-management collective bargaining agreements.  

Empirical evidence suggests that plants that adopt robots increase the hiring of new workers in all occupations as compared to non-adopters, shift their workforce composition away from other occupations (e.g., HR, sales, and finance) towards technical occupations, and gain market share (Adrianto et al. 2024b). In this study, we find that plants in conventional and employee-owned firms increase external hiring following the adoption of robots, but the effect for the latter is more limited after size differences are removed. Moreover, the compositional shift is only observed within conventional firms. Since employee-owned firms advance worker well-being (i.e., satisfaction and safety) more than conventional firms (Adrianto et al. 2024a), they will share the benefits of technological upgrades with their workers more than conventional firms. Hence, our findings indicate that employee-owned firms have more stable employment. They protect jobs by limiting new external hires in favor of incumbent workers, and therefore there will be no union or worker opposition against automation.

In sum, contrary to “Luddite” expectations, employee-owners embrace automation because ownership affords them a voice and power to protect their interest in sustaining employment and capturing productivity returns. The presence of institutional channels for worker voice and profit-sharing enshrined in ESOP legal rules and regulations appears pivotal in realizing mutual gains from manufacturing modernization.

### Are employee-owned firms more ethical? Employee ownership and environmental, social, and governance impacts

In ESOP firms, employee-owners have a longer-term perspective than external shareholders since they can realize the returns from stock ownership only when they leave the company. This poses two consequences. First, they may choose organizational policies that ensure operational sustainability. Second, they may prioritize their (selfish) well-being instead of that of external parties (i.e., external shareholders, customers, and society). In this study, I test the two predictions. I compare public employee-owned firms with public conventional firms with respect to their ratings on the long-term commitment to socially responsible investments and ESG investment standards, and the levels of emissions and environmental violations.

### Does automation make the workplace more equitable? Examining the effects of emerging technologies on gender and race

Automation reduces physical strain in labor-intensive jobs, thus broadening the opportunities for jobs that were predominantly occupied by men into those that women and people with disabilities can enter. For instance, robots and automated systems substitute manual and physically demanding tasks, alleviating barriers related to physical strength. Automation also enhances process transparency and standardization, facilitating more objective performance evaluations and reducing potential biases against minority groups. In this study, I investigate the effect of change in technology intensity in the same local labor market and industry on the likelihood that women and people with disabilities enter occupations with high automation.

### Artificial intelligence and skill complementarity and substitution: Evidence from job postings

_Co-authored with Avner Ben-Ner_

In this paper, I investigate the evolution of AI capabilities and how they complement and substitute human skills over time. I study AI and other complementary technologies (e.g., robotics, specialized software, and specialized machinery) as a system, leveraging the wealth of information on skill requirements from online job postings and other sources.

### The effect of the anti-abuse rules for S corporations on the development of ESOP in the US

The year 2001 marked the beginning of a series of regulations that dealt with abuses of the ERISA Law related to ESOP tax benefits. In 2001, Congress enacted legislation to address both actual and anticipated situations that could lead to an inappropriate deferral or avoidance of tax in certain S corporation ESOP structures. New criteria were added to limit the tax benefits of ESOPs maintained by S corporations to those in which the ESOP is designed to provide a meaningful benefit to a broad base of rank-and-file employees. March 14, 2001, marked the date after which all S corporation ESOPs must comply with the new rules. This study explores the effect on corporate behaviors in response to the more limiting ESOP regulations.
   
### Risk tolerance: Do employee-owned firms hire workers that fit with the ownership culture?

Previous studies show that employee-owned firms have distinct human resource practices that distinguish them from conventional firms (e.g., group-based incentives and higher autonomy). One highly cited such practice is the compensation package in employee-owned firms in the form of ownership shares, which tends to be riskier than base salary. As such, ESOP firms may want to hire employees who fit the “risky” ownership culture, and only those who have a high tolerance for risk will be willing to join these firms. I investigate whether employees in employee-owned firms are more risk-tolerant than those in other firms with no such plan.
