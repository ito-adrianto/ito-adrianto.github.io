Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Work and Organizations Department at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. I study how technology and employee ownership shape the future of work and worker well-being. My research addresses one of today's most pressing questions: How can we ensure technological progress benefits both organizations and their employees? My research explores how the adoption of technology and employee ownership influences key measures of work organization and employee well-being, such as span of control, specialization, productivity, employment, skill demand, compensation, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and mental and physical health. I work with large-scale data and use econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences and instrumental variables designs, to carry out my investigations.

Before starting my Ph.D. in 2020, I worked for eleven years as an organizational analyst in the Indonesian government, during which I accumulated rich experience in strategic human capital. My duties included formulating organizational roadmaps, assessing organizational health, and teaching several employee training courses on human resource management.

I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market.
